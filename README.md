# Puzzles
## Summary
This repo is just a collection of various coding puzzles that I've encountered while learning/continuing to learn to code with some solutions (in different languages if possible). My aim is to have a helpful resource of challenges to practice and refer to.

## Layout
Descriptions of every coding challenge will be stored in the descriptions folder. Solutions will be stored in the solutions folder and split by puzzle.
