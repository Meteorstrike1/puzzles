## Leap years
 
Given a year, determine if it is a leap year.
 
In the Gregorian calendar, the algorithm is that a leap year occurs when:
 
1. The year is evenly divisible by 4
2. Except when the year is evenly divisible by 100
3. Unless the year is evenly divisible by 400
 
So 1997 is not a leap year but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year but 2000 is.
