## Vending machine change

You are working with a vending machine manufacturer. When the vending machine gives a customer some change, it needs to
give the fewest coins possible (nobody wants a pocket full of 1p coins).

The machine has coins of the following denominations:
- 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2

### Examples
- asking for £2.70 in change should give [£2, 50p, 20p]
- asking for 39p in change should give [20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, 2p]
